Though asked to output several error plots in the second problem, the plots are almost identical and not much information are provided. Hand in those plots are somehow meaningless.

Instead, plots of the error and residual l^2 norm, from line g-s and point g-s iterations, with N=256 and eps=1e-5, are provided here. Some comparisons can be made according to the plots here.

The original plot are too obscure, due to the great variation of the error (residual) norm. 

A log(1+x) and a log(x) transformation is taken to show the total trend here.
